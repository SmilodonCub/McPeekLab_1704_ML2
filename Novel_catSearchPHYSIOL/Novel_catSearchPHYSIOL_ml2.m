%   .timing script for categorical_search_training, a MonkeyLogic task 
%   1) a category specific fixation point (blue:butterfly red:bear) appears
%   for wait_for_fix msec
%   2) subjects holds fixation for initial_fix msec
%   3) on some trials a target is presented: the target (e.g. TBear) is 
%   presented in an array with a lure from the other category (e.g. BFly) 
%   and a set number of distractors (optional). the subject has 
%   max_reaction_time msec to complete a saccade to the target. 
%   4) the subject then holds fixation on the target for hold_target_time
%   msec to recieve a reward
%   5) on other trials, there is no target present, only the lure & 
%   distractors. in this case, the subject has max_reaction_time to fixate 
%   on the TA_button in the periphery and hold for hold_target_time to 
%   recieve a reward.
